# Autodesk Fusion MCP Server

Standalone MCP server that runs inside Autodesk Fusion (formerly Autodesk
Fusion 360) as an add-in. AI agents connect over **Streamable HTTP** -- the
current MCP transport specification -- with no external proxy, middleware, or
dependencies required.

## Highlights

- **Streamable HTTP transport** -- implements the MCP Streamable HTTP spec
  natively; no legacy SSE polling or sidecar servers.
- **Protocol compatibility** -- supports stateless `2026-07-28` requests and
  retains `2025-11-25`, `2025-06-18`, and `2025-03-26` clients on the same
  endpoint. See [protocol behavior and compatibility](docs/mcp-protocol-compatibility.md).
- **Zero external dependencies** -- uses only Python's standard library and
  the Fusion SDK (`adsk.*`).
- **Thread-safe bridge** -- HTTP requests are relayed to Fusion's main thread
  via a Custom Event / work-queue dispatcher, preventing crashes.
- **13 dedicated MCP tools** -- each with a clean, focused schema for better
  LLM tool selection.

## Supported Platforms

- Windows
- Mac OS

## Installation

### Option A: Install from release zip (recommended)

1. Download `AutodeskFusionMCP-v*.zip` from the
   [Releases](https://github.com/frankhommers/autodesk-fusion-mcp/releases)
   page.
2. Extract the zip into your Fusion add-ins folder:
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion 360/API/AddIns/`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns\`
3. Make sure the extracted folder is named `AutodeskFusionMCP` (rename it if
   the zip extracts to a different name).
4. Open Fusion, press **Shift+S**, select the **Add-Ins** tab, and run
   **AutodeskFusionMCP**.
5. The server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`.

### Option B: Clone from source

1. Clone this repository into your Fusion add-ins folder:
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion 360/API/AddIns/`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns\`
2. Make sure the directory is named `AutodeskFusionMCP`.
3. Open Fusion, press **Shift+S**, select the **Add-Ins** tab, and run
   **AutodeskFusionMCP**.
4. The server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`.

## MCP Client Configuration

Add to your MCP client config (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "autodesk-fusion-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `call_autodesk_api` | Execute a generic Fusion API call via dotted path |
| `execute_python` | Run Python code inside the live Fusion session |
| `capture_viewport` | PNG capture with temporary views, transparency, solid backgrounds and cropping |
| `get_viewport` | Read camera state and viewport dimensions |
| `set_viewport` | Standard views, projection, orbit, pan, zoom, fit and camera restoration |
| `get_active_selection` | Get objects currently selected in the viewport |
| `fetch_api_documentation` | Search Fusion API metadata via runtime introspection |
| `fetch_online_documentation` | Fetch Autodesk cloudhelp docs for a class/member |
| `fetch_design_guide` | Read the bundled design guide |

### Generic API example

```json
{
  "api_path": "rootComponent.sketches.add",
  "args": ["rootComponent.xYConstructionPlane"],
  "remember_as": "my_sketch"
}
```

Path shortcuts: `app`, `ui`, `design`, `rootComponent`, `$stored_name`.

Constructors accepted in args: `Point3D`, `Vector3D`, `Point2D`,
`ValueInput`, `ObjectCollection`, `Matrix3D`.

### Selection example

The `get_active_selection` tool returns details of objects selected in the
viewport and stores them as `$selection_0`, `$selection_1`, etc. for use in
follow-up API calls.

## Architecture

```
AI agent
  |  Streamable HTTP (POST/GET/DELETE /mcp)
  v
lib/mcp_server.py           -- HTTP server (threading, stdlib only)
  |
fusion_bridge/dispatch.py   -- Custom Event queue relay
  |
fusion_bridge/operations.py -- per-tool routing
  |
fusion_bridge/selection.py  -- viewport selection reader
fusion_bridge/python_exec.py -- Python execution
fusion_bridge/viewport.py   -- camera controls and viewport capture
fusion_bridge/doc_lookup.py -- API docs introspection
fusion_bridge/script_store.py -- script CRUD
  |
adsk.core / adsk.fusion     -- Fusion 360 SDK (main thread)
```

## Testing

### Unit tests

Run the test suite (no Fusion required):

```
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

CI runs these tests on every push and pull request via GitHub Actions.
Real HTTP tests cover both protocol eras, connection reuse, and cancellation
without requiring Fusion. A live Fusion/client smoke test is still needed
before releasing transport changes.

### Protocol compliance with MCP Inspector

The official [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
can verify Streamable HTTP compliance against a running server.

**Against the live Fusion add-in** (port 8765):

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp --transport http --method tools/list
```

**Against the standalone test server** (no Fusion required):

```
python3 test_server.py                  # starts a dummy server on port 9765
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli http://127.0.0.1:9765/mcp --transport http --method tools/list
```

## Changelog

- v 1.4.1
  - Wait for Fusion's main thread before binding the MCP server; bound
    dispatcher waits and distinguish queued cancellation from running work
  - Scope legacy cancellation by server, session, and request ID; retire
    queued work and background startup tasks when the add-in stops
  - Add regression coverage for cancellation isolation and Stop/Run races;
    133 automated tests pass on Linux, macOS, and Windows

- v 1.4.0
  - Add `get_viewport` and `set_viewport`: camera snapshots, standard views,
    projection, orbit, pan, zoom, and fit
  - Extend `capture_viewport` with temporary views, transparent or solid
    backgrounds, anti-aliasing control, native dimensions, and cropping
  - Support MCP `2026-07-28` while retaining all three supported 2025
    revisions on the same endpoint; persistent Python calls using the new
    protocol require an explicit `session_id`
  - Fix empty-response framing for HTTP keep-alive clients; validate browser
    origins and scope modern cancellation to individual requests
  - Log the Fusion and Python runtime versions; verify the bundled Autodesk
    utilities against Fusion 2705.1.11
  - Validate with 108 automated tests and 35 live viewport checks on macOS;
    expand Python 3.14 CI to Linux, macOS, and Windows

- v 1.3.0
  - `fetch_online_documentation` returns a `preview` flag, so an agent can see
    that a class is preview API before building on it. Autodesk renames these
    between releases without a deprecation period
  - Design guide: fixed every example, which wrapped its arguments in an
    `operation` field that no tool accepts
  - Design guide: new sections on preview APIs and on sheet metal ordering,
    covering `foldFeatures`, `joinByBendFeatures`, `cornerClosureFeatures` and
    flat patterns

- v 1.2.0
  - `fetch_online_documentation` now understands all three Autodesk help
    layouts. Property pages contribute `property_type`, `access` and
    `property_description`; class pages contribute their `methods`,
    `properties` and `accessed_from` member lists
  - Property syntax lines are recognised (they carry no argument list, and
    Autodesk leaves the emphasis tag unclosed)
  - Fixed every sample on a page inheriting the first sample's URL
  - Fixed descriptions coming back empty, as Autodesk emits `<p class="api">`

- v 1.1.0
  - Negotiate the MCP protocol version instead of always answering
    `2025-03-26`; `2025-11-25` and `2025-06-18` are now supported, which fixes
    clients refusing to connect ([#1](https://github.com/frankhommers/autodesk-fusion-mcp/issues/1))
  - Tolerate the `MCP-Protocol-Version` request header introduced in 2025-06-18
  - `/health` now reports `supported_protocols`
  - Fixed `fetch_online_documentation` silently dropping the `syntax` field
    after Autodesk changed its help markup from `<strong>` to `<b>`
  - Per-command execution duration and ISO 8601 timestamps in the log
  - CI now runs on Python 3.14, matching the interpreter Fusion bundles

- v 1.0.0
  - Initial release
  - 11 dedicated MCP tools with individual schemas
  - Streamable HTTP transport (MCP spec 2025-03-26)
  - Thread-safe main-thread dispatch
  - Viewport selection reader (`get_active_selection`)
  - Python code execution with persistent sessions
  - API documentation introspection
  - Script management (save/load/list/delete)
  - Zero external dependencies
